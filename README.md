👋 Hi, I’m Harshada Kokande

🎓 Final-year B.Tech CSE (AI/ML) student
📍 Pune, India

I’m someone who enjoys turning ideas into working systems — especially when they involve AI, data, and real-world impact. I like understanding how things work under the hood and then building them in a clean, practical way.

💡 What I Enjoy Building

AI and Machine Learning models that solve real problems

Computer Vision systems using images and video

Reinforcement Learning–based decision systems

Data-driven dashboards and analytics

End-to-end projects — from data to deployment

🛠️ Tech I Work With

Languages: Python, C++, SQL
AI / ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Keras, OpenCV
Data & Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Power BI, Excel
Frameworks: Flask, Streamlit
Core Concepts: DSA, OOP, Model Evaluation, Feature Engineering

🚀 Selected Projects

Infrastructure Crack Detection – Computer vision system to identify structural cracks from images

SheGuard – AI-enabled women safety application with smart alert features

MedConnect – Virtual health consultation web platform

Smart Irrigation using Reinforcement Learning – Optimized water usage with Q-learning and DQN

News App (Python + APIs) – Real-time news fetching and filtering application

🔬 Interests & Learning

I’m deeply interested in Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Agentic AI, and Neuromorphic Computing vs GPU-based AI. I enjoy experimenting, reading research, and converting concepts into small working prototypes.

🎯 Current Focus

Preparing for AI/ML and Software Engineering roles

Strengthening DSA in C++

Building strong, industry-ready projects

Improving ML deployment and system design skills

⭐ Learning by building. Growing by experimenting. Improving with every commit.
